2;James;1;5;6;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not and it shall be given him.  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
